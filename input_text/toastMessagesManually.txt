You might want to build a tree using only the highest/lowest information gain.
A high information gain probably leads to an optimized tree.
You might want to build a tree using only the highest/lowest gini index.
A low gini index probably leads to an optimized tree.

What happens if you mix a "good" versus a "bad" decision using a particular pattern? Let's give it a try!
You might want to check your model against your data. Does the resulted tree seem plausible to you?
What is entropy?
