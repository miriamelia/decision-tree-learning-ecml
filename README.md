Simply download the whole package and run the index.html file.
This project won't work properly with Microsoft Edge. 
Please use Firefox or Chrome.

Due to a new security policy update (cors), by default, it is no longer an option to
load local files under the same directory into the browser. However, to use this software,
it is necessary to access the .js files.

Simply run 
python -m http.server 
in your terminal.
Then, open http://localhost:8000/ and navigate to the location of the index.html to open it.

Or this new feature could be disabled (but should be enabled for further browsing):

Firefox: enter "about:config" and then change the value of "privacy.file_unique_origin" to false
