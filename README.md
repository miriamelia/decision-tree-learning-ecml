To start, download the whole package and run the index.html file.
This project won't work properly with Microsoft Edge. 
Please use Firefox or Chrome.

Due to same origin security policy (cors), by default, it is no longer an option to
load local files under the same directory into the browser.

Simply run 
**python -m http.server**
in your terminal.
Then, open http://localhost:8000/ and navigate to the location of the index.html to open it.

Or disable the restriction (but should be enabled for further browsing):

Firefox: enter "about:config" and then change the value of "privacy.file_unique_origin" to false
